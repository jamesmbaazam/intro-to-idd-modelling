# Disease Scenarios Group Assignments

## Summary

Participants are provided with a generic description of a disease and its pathogenesis.

### Task
1. Develop a model that suits the description, taking note of all decisions made, including the model diagram.
2. Identify a disease that could suit the description. What about the disease fits this description?
3. With the identified disease in mind, include more realism by simplifying some of your assumptions.
4. Incorporate a simple intervention that will impact disease transmission.
5. Code the model up in **R**.
6. Solve the model and generate easy-to-explain figures.

### Discussion

Center your discussion around the following:
- The identified disease.
- Model diagram, equations, and code.
- Design choices and assumptions.
- The simulation code and choice of parameter values.
- Generated figure(s).
- What assumptions could you relax in your model to make it more realistic?

The solution can be written in **R markdown**, **Google Docs**, or whatever medium works for you.

### Expected Outputs (Friday)

A report detailing how you addressed the problem outlined here and including any deviations.

## Disease Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Acute Infectious Disease with High Mortality and Permanent Immunity
- The disease spreads through direct human-to-human contact, including bodily fluids.
- After exposure, individuals undergo an incubation period before becoming symptomatic and highly infectious.
- The disease has a high mortality rate, and those who recover gain permanent immunity.

### Scenario 2: Asymptomatic Carriers and Recurrent Infections

- The disease spreads via direct contact between humans.
- Some individuals become asymptomatic carriers who can transmit the disease without showing symptoms.
- Symptomatic individuals recover and gain temporary immunity, after which they can become susceptible again.

### Check-in (Tuesday)

5 minutes presentation:
1. Progress with summarizing the problem.
2. Plan to solve the problem.
3. Anticipated challenges (modeling shortcomings, R programming challenges, differences in opinion, leadership, etc.).
