Diseases can be classified according to:

-   [Cause]{style="color:tomato"} (e.g., infectious, non-infectious)
-   [Duration]{style="color:tomato"} (e.g., acute, chronic)
-   [Mode of transmission]{style="color:tomato"} (direct or indirect)
-   [Impact]{style="color:tomato"} on the host (e.g., fatal, non-fatal)

Note that these classifications are not mutually exclusive. Hence, a disease can be classified under more than one category at a time.

## How are infectious diseases controlled? {#sec-control-measures}

-   In general, infectious disease control aims to reduce disease transmission.
-   The type of control used depends on the disease and its characteristics.
-   Broadly, there are two main types of control measures:
    -   Pharmaceutical interventions (PIs)
    -   Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Pharmaceutical interventions (PIs)

-   Pharmaceutical Interventions are medical interventions that target the pathogen or the host.

-   Examples:

    -   Vaccines,
    -   Antiviral drugs, and
    -   Antibiotics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Vaccination {#sec-vaccination}

-   Activates the host's immune system to produce antibodies against the pathogen.
-   Generally applied to reduce the risk of infection and disease.
-   The most effective way to prevent infectious diseases.

##### Challenges with vaccination

-   Take time to develop for new pathogens
-   Never 100% effective and limited duration of protection
-   Adverse side effects
-   Some individuals cannot be vaccinated or refuce vaccination
-   Some pathogens mutate rapidly (e.g., influenza virus)
-   Logistical challenges (e.g., cold chain requirements)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) {#sec-npi}

-   Non-pharmaceutical interventions are measures that do not involve medical interventions.

-   Examples:

    -   Quarantine,
    -   Physical/social distancing, and
    -   Mask-wearing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Quarantine

-   *Isolation of individuals who may have been exposed to a contagious disease*.
-   Advantage is that it's simple and its effectiveness does not depend on the disease.
-   Disadvantages include:
    -   Infringement on individual rights
    -   Can be difficult to enforce
    -   Can be costly
    -   Can lead to social stigma

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Contact tracing

-   Contact tracing is used to identify exposed individuals, i.e., individuals who might been in contact with an infected/infectious individual.
-   It involves identifying, assessing, and managing people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to prevent further transmission.
-   It is a critical component of infectious disease surveillance and is often used in combination with other control measures.

### Discussion

-   How can we quantify the impact of a control measure?
