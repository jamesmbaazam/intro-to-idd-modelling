## What are compartmental models?

-   Compartmental models:
    -   divide populations into compartments (or groups) based on the individual's infection status and track them through time [@Blackwood2018a].
    -   are mechanistic, meaning they describe processes such the interaction between hosts, biological processes of pathogen, host immune response, and so forth.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compartmental models are different from statistical models, which are used to describe the relationship between variables.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Individuals in a compartment:
    -   are assumed to have the same features (disease state, age, location, etc)
    -   can only be in one compartment at a time.
    -   move between compartments based on defined transition rates.

-   Common compartments:
    -   Susceptible (S) - hosts are not infected but can be infected
    -   Infected (I) - hosts are infected (and can infect others)
    -   Removed (R) - hosts are no longer infected and cannot be re-infected

-   Other compartments can be added to the model to account for important events or processes (e.g., exposed, recovered, vaccinated, etc.)

-   It is, however, important to keep the model simple, less computationally intensive, and interpretable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Compartmental models either have *discrete* or *continuous* time scales:
    -   [Discrete time scales]{style="color:tomato;"}: time is divided into discrete intervals (e.g., days, weeks, months).
    -   [Continuous time scales]{style="color:tomato;"}: time is continuous and the model is described using differential equations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Compartmental models can be *deterministic* or *stochastic*:
    -   [Deterministic]{style="color:tomato;"} models always return the same output for the same input.
    -   [Stochastic]{style="color:tomato;"} models account for randomness in the system and model output always varies. Hence, they are often run multiple times to get an average output.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   The choice of model type depends on:
    -   the research [question]{style="color:tomato"},
    -   [data]{style="color:tomato"} availability,
    -   [computational resources]{style="color:tomato"},
    -   modeller [skillset]{style="color:tomato"}.
-   In this introduction, we will focus on [deterministic compartmental models with continuous time scales]{style="color:tomato;"}.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Now, back to the models, we are going to consider infections that either confer immunity after recovery or not.
-   The simplest compartmental models for capturing this is the SIR model.
