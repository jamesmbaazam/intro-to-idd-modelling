## What are infectious disease models?

-   [*Models*]{style="color:tomato;"} generally refer to conceptual representations of an object or system.
-   [*Mathematical models*]{style="color:tomato;"} use mathematics to describe the system. For example, the famous $E = mc^2$ is a mathematical model that describes the relationship between mass and energy.
-   [*Infectious disease models*]{style="color:tomato;"} use mathematics and/or statistics to represent dynamics/spread of infectious diseases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Mathematical models can be used to link the [biological process]{style="color:tomato"} of disease transmission and the [emergent dynamics]{style="color:tomato"} of infection at the [population level]{style="color:tomato"}.
-   Models require making some [assumptions and abstractions]{style="color:tomato"}.

-   By definition, ["all models are wrong, but some are useful"]{style="color:tomato"} [@Box1979].
    -   Good enough models are those that capture the [essential features]{style="color:tomato"} of the system being studied.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   What makes models "wrong" by definition?:
    -   Models simplify reality
    -   They cannot fully capture all the complexities of the system being studied.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Factors that influence model formulation/choice

-   [Accuracy]{style="color:tomato; font-weight:bold;"}: how well does the model to reproduce observed data and predict future outcomes?
-   [Transparency]{style="color:tomato; font-weight:bold;"}: is it easy to understand and interpret the model and its outputs?
    -   This is affected by the model's complexity
-   [Flexibility]{style="color:tomato; font-weight:bold;"}: the ability of the model to be adapted to different scenarios.
    -   For example, can the model be easily modified to account for new data or changing conditions?

::: notes
These will be touched on in the scenario modelling lectures.

## What are models used for?

-   Generally, models can be used to [predict]{style="color:tomato; font-weight:bold;"} and [understand/explain]{style="color:tomato; font-weight:bold;"} the dynamics of infectious diseases.

### Discussion

How are these two uses impacted by accuracy, transparency, and flexibility? That is, which of these factors is more important for each use?

### Understanding or explaining disease dynamics

-   Models can be used to [understand how a disease spreads]{style="color:tomato"} and how its spread can be [controlled]{style="color:tomato"}.
-   The insights gained from models can be used to:
    -   [inform]{style="color:blue"} public health policy and interventions.
    -   [design]{style="color:blue"} interventions to control the spread of the disease, for example, randomised controlled trials.
    -   [collect]{style="color:blue"} new data.
    -   [build]{style="color:blue"} predictive models.

## Limitations of infectious disease models

-   Host behaviour is often difficult to predict.
-   The pathogen often has known/unknown characteristics that are difficult to capture.
-   Data is often not available or is of poor quality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Summary

-   Models:
    -   Simplify reality and allow us to understand complex systems.\
    -   [Simplifications of reality]{style="color:tomato"} and do not capture all the [complexities]{style="color:tomato"} of the system being studied.
    -   Only as good as the [data]{style="color:tomato"} used to calibrate them.
    -   Sensitive to the [assumptions]{style="color:tomato"} made during their formulation.
    -   [Computationally expensive]{style="color:tomato"} and require a lot of data to run.
    -   [Difficult to interpret]{style="color:tomato"} and communicate to non-experts.
