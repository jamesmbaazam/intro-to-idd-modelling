## What are infectious disease models?

-   [*Models*]{style="color:tomato;"} generally refer to conceptual representations of an object or system.
-   [*Mathematical models*]{style="color:tomato;"} use mathematics to describe the system. For example, the famous $E = mc^2$ is a mathematical model that describes the relationship between mass and energy.
-   [*Infectious disease models*]{style="color:tomato;"} use mathematics/statistics to represent dynamics/spread of infectious diseases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Mathematical models can be used to link the biological process of disease transmission and the emergent dynamics of infection at the population level.
-   Models require making some assumptions and abstractions.

    -   Good enough models are those that capture the [essential features]{style="color:tomato"} of the system being studied.

-   What makes models "wrong" by definition?:
    -   Simplifications of reality; not capturing all the complexities of the system being studied.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Factors that influence model formulation/choice

-   [Accuracy]{style="color:tomato"}: how well does the model to reproduce observed data and predict future outcomes?
-   [Transparency]{style="color:tomato"}: is it easy to understand and interpret the model and its outputs? (This is affected by the model's complexity)
-   [Flexibility]{style="color:tomato"}: the ability of the model to be adapted to different scenarios.

These will be touched on in the scenario modelling lectures.

## What are models used for?

-   Generally, models can be used to predict and understand/explain the dynamics of infectious diseases.

### Discussion

How are these two uses impacted by accuracy, transparency, and flexibility?

### Understanding or explaining disease dynamics

-   Models can be used to understand how a disease spreads and how its spread can be controlled.
-   The insights gained from models can be used to:
    -   inform public health policy and interventions.
    -   design interventions to control the spread of the disease, for example, randomised controlled trials.
    -   collect new data.
    -   build predictive models.

## Limitations of infectious disease models

-   Host behaviour is often difficult to predict.
-   The pathogen often has unknown characteristics or known characteristics that are difficult to model.
-   Data is often not available or is of poor quality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Summary

-   Models:
    -   [Simplifications of reality]{style="color:tomato"} and do not capture all the [complexities]{style="color:tomato"} of the system being studied.
    -   Only as good as the [data]{style="color:tomato"} used to parameterize them.
    -   Sensitive to the [assumptions]{style="color:tomato"} made during their formulation.
    -   [Computationally expensive]{style="color:tomato"} and require a lot of data to run.
    -   [Difficult to interpret]{style="color:tomato"} and communicate to non-experts.
