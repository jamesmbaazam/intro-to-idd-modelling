This model groups individuals into three *disease states*:

-   [Susceptible (S)]{style="color:green;"}: not infected but can be.

-   [Infected (I)]{style="color:tomato;"}: infected & infectious.

-   [Recovered/removed (R)]{style="color:blue;"}: recovered & immune.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### How do individuals move between compartments?

#### Process 1: Transmission

![](images/model_diagrams/model_diagrams.002.jpeg){width="70%"}

[What drives transmission?]{style="color:red;"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Transmission is driven by several factors, including:
    -   Disease prevalence, [$I$]{style="color:blue;"}, i.e., number of infected individuals at the time.
    -   The number of contacts, [$C$]{style="color:blue;"}, susceptible individuals have with infected individual.
    -   The probability, [$p$]{style="color:blue;"}, a susceptible individual will become infected when they contact an infected individual.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](images/model_diagrams/model_diagrams.002.jpeg){width="70%"}

The transmission term is often defined through the [force of infection (FOI), $\lambda$]{style="color:tomato;"}.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### A tour of the force of infection (FOI)

-   FOI, $\lambda$, is the [per capita rate]{style="color:tomato;"} at which susceptible individuals become infected.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
"Per capita" means the rate of an event occurring per individual in the population per unit of time.
:::

-   Given the rate per individual per time, FOI, the rate at which new infecteds are generated is given by [$\lambda \times S$]{style="color:blue;"}, where $S$ is the number of susceptible individuals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   The force of infection is made up of the probabilities/rates that:
    -   contacts happen, [$c$]{style="color:blue"},
    -   a given contact is with an infected individual, [$p$]{style="color:blue"}, and
    -   a contact results in successful transmission, [$v$]{style="color:blue"}.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   The FOI can be formulated in two ways, depending on how the contact rate is expected to change with the population size:
    -   Frequency-dependent/mass action transmission
    -   Density-dependent transmission

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Frequency-dependent/mass action transmission

The rate of contact between individuals is constant irrespective of the population density, [$\dfrac{N}{A}$]{style="color:blue"}, where [$N$]{style="color:blue"} is the population size and [$A$]{style="color:blue"} is the area occupied by the population.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Recall that transmission also depends on the probability of contact with an infected host, [$p$]{style="color:blue"}, which is assumed to be [$\dfrac{I}{N}$]{style="color:blue"}.

-   Hence, the frequency-dependent mass action is given by [$\lambda = \beta \times \dfrac{I}{N}$]{style="color:blue"}, where [$\beta$]{style="color:blue"} is the transmission rate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true" icon="false"}
#### Question

Why does the frequency-dependent transmission contain [$\dfrac{1}{N}$]{style="color:blue"} if it does not depend on the population density?
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Assume that the rate of new infections is given by [$\dfrac{dI}{dt} = S \times c \times p \times v$]{style="color:blue"} where [$S$]{style="color:blue"} is the number of susceptible hosts, [$c$]{style="color:blue"} is the contact rate, and [$p$]{style="color:blue"} is the probability of contact with an infected host, and [$v$]{style="color:blue"} is the probability of transmission per contact.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   [$p$]{style="color:blue"} is usually assumed to be the disease prevalence, [$\dfrac{I}{N}$]{style="color:blue"}.

-   Hence, the rate of new infections, [$\dfrac{dI}{dt} = S \times c \times \dfrac{I}{N}  \times v$]{style="color:blue;"}.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   In frequency dependent transmission, the contact rate [$c$]{style="color:blue"} is also assumed to be constant, say [$c = \eta$]{style="color:blue"} irrespective of population density, [$\dfrac{N}{A}$]{style="color:blue"}, where [$N$]{style="color:blue"} is the population size and [$A$]{style="color:blue"} is the area occupied by the population.
-   Hence, [$\dfrac{dI}{dt} = S \times \eta \times v \times \dfrac{I}{N}$]{style="color:blue"}
-   Therefore, [$\dfrac{dI}{dt} = \beta S \times \dfrac{I}{N}$]{style="color:blue"}, where [$\beta = \eta \times v$]{style="color:blue"}, and [$\lambda = \beta \times \dfrac{I}{N}$]{style="color:blue"}.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   [*Frequency-dependent/mass action transmission*]{style="color:tomato;"} is often used to model sexually-transmitted diseases and diseases with heterogeneity in contact rates.
-   Sexual transmission in this case does not depend on how many infected individuals are in the population.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Density dependent transmission

-   The rate of contact between individuals depends on the population density, [$\dfrac{N}{A}$]{style="color:blue"}.

-   Transmission also depends on [$p$]{style="color:blue"} - the probability that a given contact is with an infected individual, often taken to be [$\dfrac{I}{N}$]{style="color:blue"}.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   The density-dependent transmission is therefore given as [$\lambda = \beta \times \dfrac{I}{A}$]{style="color:blue"}.

-   Here, because transmission increases with the density of infected individuals, it is called density-dependent transmission.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
-   Notice that [$\lambda = \beta \times \dfrac{I}{N} \times \dfrac{N}{A}$]{style="color:blue"} and the $N's$ cancel out.

-   [$A$]{style="color:blue"} is often ignored.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   [*Density dependent transmission*]{style="color:tomato;"} can be used to model airborne and directly transmitted diseases, for example, measles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true" icon="false"}
#### Density-dependent vs frequency dependent transmission

This is one of the most confused and debated concepts in disease modelling. Several studies have attempted to clarify it, including the brilliant work by @begon2002clarification. Most of the clarifications provided here are based on this paper.
:::

-   We will only use the [density-dependent]{style="color:tomato;"} formulation in this course.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Process 2: Recovery

![](images/model_diagrams/model_diagrams.005.jpeg){width="60%" fig-align="center"}

[Recovery]{style="color:tomato;"}, governed by the recovery rate, $\gamma$ (rate at which infected individuals recover and become immune).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Some notes on the recovery process

-   If the duration of infection is [$\dfrac{1}{\gamma}$]{style="color:blue"}, then the rate at which infected individuals recover is [$\gamma$]{style="color:blue"}.

-   The average infectious period is often [estimated from epidemiological data]{style="color:tomato;"}.

### Putting it all together

![An SIR model with transmission rate, $\beta$, and recovery rate, $\gamma$.](images/model_diagrams/model_diagrams.006.jpeg){width="80%"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Formulating the model equations

[Continuous time compartmental]{style="color:tomato;"} models are formulated using [differential equations]{style="color:tomato;"} that describe the change in the number of individuals in each compartment over time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SIR model can be formulated as:

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/model_diagrams/model_diagrams.006.jpeg){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} & = \dot{S}  = \color{orange}{-\beta S I} \\
\frac{dI}{dt} & = \dot{I}  = \color{orange}{\beta S I} - \color{blue}{\gamma I} \\
\frac{dR}{dt} & = \dot{R} = \color{blue}{\gamma I}
\end{align*}
:::
:::::

where [$\beta$]{style="color:blue;"} is the transmission rate, and [$\gamma$]{style="color:blue;"} is the recovery rate.

::: notes
-   We may or may not use the dot notation to denote the rate of change.
-   The terms are just **inflows** and **outflows**.
-   **Pause** for questions and clarifications.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The initial conditions are given by:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
S(0) & = N - 1,\\
I(0) & = 1, \text{and} \\
R(0) & = 0.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

where $N$ is the total population size.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
-   We represent the compartments as [population sizes]{style="color:tomato;"}.:
    -   Some modellers often use [proportions]{style="color:tomato;"} instead of population sizes as a way to remove the dimensions from the equations.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Model assumptions

-   The population is closed: no births, deaths, or migration.
    -   Implicitly: the epidemic occurs much faster than the time scale of births, deaths, or migration.
-   Individuals are infectious immediately after infection and remain infectious until they recover.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Mixing is *homogeneous*, i.e., [individuals mix randomly]{style="color:tomato;"}:

-   Individuals have an equal probability of coming into contact with any other individual in the population.

-   Transition rates are constant and do not change over time.

-   Individuals acquire "lifelong" immunity after recovery.

::: notes
The $R$ compartment is an absorbing state in this model.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true" icon="false"}
#### Discussion

-   What diseases do you think the SIR model is appropriate for?
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   The SIR model is appropriate for diseases that confer immunity after recovery. For example, measles and chicken pox.
-   Popularised by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 [@kermack1927contribution]
    -   A must-read paper for budding infectious disease modellers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What questions can we answer with the SIR model?

-   The SIR model can be used to understand the dynamics of an epidemic:
    -   How long will the epidemic last?
    -   How many individuals will be infected (final epidemic size)?
    -   When will the epidemic reach its peak?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Solving the SIR model

-   Compartmental models cannot be solved analytically.

-   We often perform two types of analyses to understand the [long term dynamics]{style="color:tomato;"} of the model:

    -   Qualitative: threshold phenomena and analysis of equilibria (disease-free and endemic).\
    -   Numerical simulations.

::: callout-note
-   For this introductory course, we will use focus on simulation.
:::

-   But first, let's do some qualitative analysis of the SIR.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Threshold phenomena

-   Here, we study the conditions under which an epidemic will [grow or die out]{style="color:tomato;"} using the model equations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Consider the case where $I(0) = 1$ individual is introduced into a population of size $N$ at time $t = 0$.

-   That means in a completely susceptible population, we have $S(0) = N - 1$ susceptible individuals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   At time 0, the disease will not spread if the rate of change of infections is negative, that is [$\dfrac{dI}{dt} < 0$]{style="color:blue;"}.

-   Recall from the SIR model that [$\dfrac{dI}{dt} = \beta S I - \gamma I$]{style="color:blue;"}.

-   Let's solve this equation at $t = 0$ by setting $I = 1$, assuming [$\dfrac{dI}{dt} < 0$]{style="color:blue;"}.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

At $t = 0$, we have

\begin{equation*}
\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta S I - \gamma I < 0 \end{equation*}

Factor out $I$, and we get

\begin{equation*}
I (\beta S - \gamma) < 0
\end{equation*}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Since at $t=0$$, I > 0$, we have [$S < \dfrac{\gamma}{\beta}$]{style="color:blue;"}.

-   [$\dfrac{\gamma}{\beta}$]{style="color:blue;"} is the relative removal rate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Interpretation**:

    -   At $t = 0$, $S$ must be less than $\dfrac{\gamma}{\beta}$ for the epidemic to die out.
    -   If the rate of removal/recovery is greater than the transmission rate, the epidemic will die out.
    -   Any infection that cannot transmit to more than one host is going to die out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the SIR model, the quantity [$\dfrac{\beta}{\gamma}$]{style="color:blue"} is called the [reproduction number, $R0$]{style="color:tomato"} (pronounced "R naught" or "R zero").

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### The basic reproduction number, R0

-   The basic reproduction number, [$R0$]{style="color:blue"}, is the average number of secondary infections generated by a [single primary infection]{style="color:tomato"} in a [completely susceptible]{style="color:tomato"} population.

-   The basic reproduction number is a key quantity in infectious disease epidemiology.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   It is often represented as a single number or a range of high-low values.
    -   For example, the $R0$ for measles is popularly known to be $12$ - $18$ [@guerra2017measlesR0].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   $R0$ is often used to express the threshold phenomena in infectious disease epidemiology:
    -   If $R0 > 1$, the epidemic will grow.
    -   If $R0 < 1$, the epidemic will decline.
-   A pathogen's $R0$ value is determined by biological characteristics of the pathogen and the host's behaviour.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Conceptually, $R0$ is given by

$$
R0 \propto \dfrac{\text{Infection}}{\text{Contact}} \times \dfrac{\text{Contact}}{\text{Time}} \times \dfrac{\text{Time}}{\text{Infection}}
$$

-   $R0$ is unitless and dimensionless.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Numerical simulations

-   Numerical simulations can be performed with any programming language.

-   This course focuses on the R programming language because:

    -   It is a popular language for data analysis and statistical computing.
    -   It has a rich ecosystem of packages for solving differential equations.
    -   It is free and open-source.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   In R, we can use the `{deSolve}` package to solve the differential equations.

-   To solve the model in R with `{deSolve}`, we will always need to define at least three things:

    -   The model equations.
    -   The initial parameter values.
    -   The initial conditions (population sizes).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Practicals

-   Let's do a code walk through in R using the script [`sir.Rmd`](https://github.com/jamesmbaazam/mppr_r_practicals/tree/main/model_implementation_practicals).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true" icon="false"}
#### Discussion

-   What happens if we increase or decrease the value of $R0$?
-   What happens if we increase or decrease the value of the infectious period?
-   How can we flatten the curve?
:::

::: notes
-   We can flatten the curve by reducing the value of $R0$.
-   In reality, we can reduce $R0$ by implementing control measures such as social distancing, wearing masks, and vaccination.
-   These control measures reduce the number of contacts between individuals or the probability of infection, which in turn reduces the transmission rate.
