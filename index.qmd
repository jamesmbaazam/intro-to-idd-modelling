### Lecture Overview

This lecture introduces participants to some foundational concepts in infectious disease modelling, focusing on the basics of compartmental models, and especially the SIR model and its extensions (SEIR, SEIRV), and developing an understanding of the derivation and interpretation of the basic reproduction number, $R0$.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have a basic understanding of calculus and differential equations, as well as some familiarity with the R programming language.

## Course Materials

-   Lecture slides
-   R script templates for exercises
-   Recommended readings and resources list

## Learning Objectives

- An overview of infectious diseases and control.
- Foundations of infectious disease modelling.
- Introduction to compartmental modelling:
    - Implement and analyse homogeneous compartmental models (SIR and SEIR).
-  Derive/calculate and interpret the basic reproduction number (R0).
-  Introduction to models of infectious disease control:
    - Implement and analyse models with control measures (SEIRV and SEIR + simple NPI).
-   Incorporating heterogeneity in populations:
    - Models with age structure
    - Notes on other heterogeneities: spatial and network structure.
-  Interpreting model parameters and outputs.
-  Assessing model assumptions and limitations.
