This repository contains the materials for the “Introduction to Infectious Disease Dynamics Modelling” part of the online session of the "Modelling for Pandemic Preparedness and Response" modular short course run by the German West African Centre for Global Health and Pandemic Prevention (G-WAC) at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology.

The course was divided into two parts: one week online and one week in person in Ghana. It is designed to provide an introduction to infectious disease dynamics modelling using R and is aimed at individuals in public health, epidemiology, and related disciplines. It is interactive and hands-on, with a focus on practical applications of infectious disease dynamics modelling to pandemic response.

The materials here were prepared and taught by [Dr. James Azam](https://jamesmbaazam.github.io/jamesmbaazam/). 

For materials from the in-person part, see [here](https://jamesmbaazam.github.io/mppr/).
