Hence, a disease can be classified under more than one category at a time.\n:::\n\n::::\n\n## What is infectious disease modeling?\n\n\n## What are models used for?\n\n- Mathematical models often have three main purposes in infectious disease epidemiology:\n  - To understand the spread and dynamics of infectious diseases\n  - To predict the future course of an outbreak\n  - To evaluate the impact of interventions and determine the next course of action\n\n# Deterministic compartmental models\n\n## What are compartmental models?\n\n- Compartmental models are a type of mathematical model used to describe the\nspread of infectious diseases in a population.\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n- They divide the population into compartments based on the [disease status]{style=\"color:red;\"} of individuals.\n- The most common compartments are:\n  - Susceptible (S) - hosts are not infected but can be infected\n  - Infected (I) - hosts are infected (and can infect others)\n  - Removed (R) - hosts are no longer infected and cannot be re-infected\n- In compartmental models, individuals move between compartments based on defined\ntransition quantities.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n![Infection timeline illustrating how a pathogen in a host interacts with the host's immune system (source: Modelling Infectious Diseases of Humans and Animals)](images/infection_timeline.png){.lightbox}\n:::\n\n::::\n\n---\n\n- Other compartments can be added to the model to account for important events or\nprocesses (e.g., exposed, recovered, vaccinated, etc.)\n\n- It is, however, important to keep the model simple, less computationally\nintensive, and interpretable.\n\n# The Basic Reproduction Number\n\n# Analyzing Model Outputs and Dynamics\n\n# Wrap-Up and Q&A\n\n# List of Resources\n\n## Textbooks\n\n- [Modeling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals by Matt Keeling and Pejman Rohani](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Modeling-Infectious-Diseases-Humans-Animals/dp/0691116172)\n-[Epidemics: Models and Data Using R by Ottar N.
