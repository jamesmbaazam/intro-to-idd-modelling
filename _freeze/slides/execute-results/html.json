Hence, a disease can be classified under more than one category at a time.\n\n## How are infectious diseases controlled?\n\n-   In general, infectious disease control aims to reduce disease transmission.\n-   The type of control used depends on the disease and its characteristics.\n-   Broadly, there are two main types of control measures:\n    -   Pharmaceutical interventions (PIs)\n    -   Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Pharmaceutical interventions (PIs)\n\n-   Pharmaceutical Interventions are medical interventions that target the pathogen or the host.\n\n-   Examples:\n\n    -   Vaccines,\n    -   Antiviral drugs, and\n    -   Antibiotics.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Vaccination\n\n-   Most effective way to prevent infectious diseases.\n-   Activates the host's immune system to produce antibodies against the pathogen.\n-   Generally applied prophylactically to susceptible individuals (before infection); this reduces the risk of infection and disease.\n-   Challenges:\n    -   Take time to develop for new pathogens\n    -   Never 100% effective and limited duration of protection\n    -   Adverse side effects\n    -   Some individuals cannot be vaccinated or refuce vaccination\n    -   Some pathogens mutate rapidly (e.g., influenza virus)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)\n\n-   Non-pharmaceutical interventions are measures that do not involve medical interventions.\n\n-   Examples:\n\n    -   Quarantine,\n    -   Physical/social distancing, and\n    -   Mask-wearing.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Quarantine\n\n-   *Isolation of individuals who may have been exposed to a contagious disease*.\n-   Advantage is that it's simple and its effectiveness does not depend on the disease.\n-   Disadvantages include:\n    -   Infringement on individual rights\n    -   Can be difficult to enforce\n    -   Can be costly\n    -   Can lead to social stigma\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Contact tracing\n\n-   Contact tracing is used to identify exposed individuals, i.e., individuals who might been in contact with an infected/infectious individual.\n-   It involves identifying, assessing, and managing people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to prevent further transmission.\n-   It is a critical component of infectious disease surveillance and is often used in combination with other control measures.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=false}\n## Discussion\n\n- How can we quantify the impact of a control measure?\n:::\n\n# Infectious disease models\n\n## What are infectious disease models?\n\n-   [*Models*]{style=\"color:red;\"} generally refer to conceptual representations of an object or system.\n-   [*Mathematical models*]{style=\"color:red;\"} use mathematics to describe the system. For example, the famous $E = mc^2$ is a mathematical model that describes the relationship between mass and energy.\n-   [*Infectious disease models*]{style=\"color:red;\"} use mathematics/statistics to represent dynamics/spread of infectious diseases.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   Mathematical models can be used to link the biological process of disease transmission and the emergent dynamics of infection at the population level.\n-   Models require making some assumptions and abstractions.\n\n---\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n-   By definition, \"all models are wrong, but some are useful\" [@Box1979].\n    -   Good enough models are those that capture the essential features of the system being studied.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n![By DavidMCEddy at en.wikipedia, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=115167166](images/GeorgeEPBox.jpeg){.lightbox}\n:::\n:::\n\n---\n\n-   \"Wrong\" here means that models are simplifications of reality and do not capture all the complexities of the system being studied.

For example, measles.\n- This SIR framework was popularised by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 [@kermack1927contribution]\n  - A must-read paper for anyone interested in infectious disease modelling.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n![Face of a boy with measles.

This is often described as a _closed population_.\n  - That is, the epidemic occurs much faster than the time scale of births, deaths, or migration.\n\n- Mixing is _homogeneous_, i.e., [individuals mix randomly]{style=\"color:orange;\"} and have an equal probability of coming into contact with any other individual in the population.\n\n- Transition rates are constant and do not change over time.\n\n---\n\n## How do individuals move between compartments?\n\n- There are two processes that govern the transitions between compartments:\n  - [Transmission]{style=\"color:orange;\"}, governed by the transmission rate, $\\beta$ (rate at which susceptible individuals become infected).\n  - [Recovery]{style=\"color:orange;\"}, governed by the recovery rate, $\\gamma$ (rate at which infected individuals recover and become immune).\n  \n---\n\n### Transmission\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=false}\n### Discussion\n\n- What factors drive transmission?\n:::\n\n---\n\n- Transmission is driven by several factors:\n  - The prevalence, [$I$]{style=\"color:orange;\"}, i.e., number of infected individuals at the time.\n  - The number of contacts, [$C$]{style=\"color:orange;\"}, susceptible individuals have with infected individual.\n  - The probability, [$p$]{style=\"color:orange;\"}, a susceptible individual will become infected when they contact an infected individual.\n\n---\n\n- The transmission term is often defined through the force of infection (FOI), $\\lambda$:\n  - The force of infection is the [per capita rate]{style=\"color:orange;\"} at which susceptible individuals become infected.\n\n- The rate at which new infecteds are generated is given by [$\\lambda S$]{style=\"color:orange;\"}, where $S$ is the number of susceptible individuals.\n\n- The force of infection is proportional to the number of infected individuals and the transmission rate, [$\\beta$]{style=\"color:orange;\"}.\n\n- $\\beta$ is the product of the contact rate and the probability of transmission per contact.\n\n---\n\n- The FOI can be formulated in two ways, depending on how the contact rate is expected to change with the population size:\n  - [_Frequency-dependent/mass action transmission_]{style=\"color:orange;\"}: The rate of contact between individuals is proportional to the population size. Here, [$\\lambda = \\beta \\times \\dfrac{I}{N}$]{style=\"color:orange;\"}.\n  - [_Density dependent transmission_]{style=\"color:orange;\"}: The rate of contact between individuals is independent of the population size. Here, [$\\lambda = \\beta \\times I$]{style=\"color:orange;\"}.\n\n---\n\n- Frequency-dependent transmission assumes that that the number of contacts an individual has is independent of the population size:\n  - Often used to model vector-borned diseases and diseases with heterogeneity in contact rates.\n\n---\n\n- Density-dependent transmission assumes that the number of contacts an individual has is proportional to the population size:\n  - Often used to model diseases that allow the safe assumption of random/homogenous mixing.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe differences become important when dealing with population sizes that change significantly over time.\n:::\n\n---\n\n- The recovery rate $\\gamma$ is the reciprocal of the average duration of the infection. That is, infected individuals spend $1/\\gamma$ days in the infected compartment before recovering.\n\n- The average infectious period is often estimated from epidemiological data.\n\n## Threshold phenomena\n\n- Let's study the factors that will determine whether an epidemic will grow or not.\n\n- Consider the case where $I(0)$ individuals are introduced into a population of size $N$ at time $t = 0$.\n\n- That means in a completely susceptible population, we have $S(0) = N - I(0)$ susceptibles.\n\n- Recall from the SIR model that $\\dfrac{dI}{dt} = I (\\beta S - \\gamma)$\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=false}\n### Discussion\n\n- What will cause $\\dfrac{dI}{dt} > 0$? and how do we interpret it?\n:::\n\n---\n\n- $\\dfrac{dI}{dt} > 0$ when $S > \\dfrac{\\gamma}{\\beta}$\n\n- Hence, at $t = 0$, $S(0)$ must be greater than $\\dfrac{\\gamma}{\\beta}$ for the epidemic to grow.\n\n- This can be interpreted to mean that we require the rate of recovery must be less than the rate of transmission for the epidemic to grow.\n\n- The reverse of the removal rate is the reproduction number, $R_0 = \\dfrac{\\beta}{\\gamma}$.\n\n# The Basic Reproduction Number\n\n- The basic reproduction number, [$R_0$]{style=\"color:tomato\"}, is the rate at which secondary infections are generated from a [single primary infection]{style=\"color:tomato\"} in a [completely susceptible]{style=\"color:tomato\"} population.\n\n- $R0$ is often used to express the threshold phenomena in infectious disease epidemiology:\n  - If $R_0 > 1$, the epidemic will grow.\n  - If $R_0 < 1$, the epidemic will decline.\n  \n- The value of $R0$ is determined by the disease and characteristics of the population.\n\n- We will learn how to derive $R_0$ from various model structures in a dedicated section.\n\n## Solving the SIR model\n\n- Compartmental models cannot be solved analytically.\n\n- Other methods are used to understand the dynamics of the model:\n  - Qualitative analysis of the equations; threshold phenomena.\n  - Numerical simulations.\n\n---\n\n### Numerical simulations\n\n- Numerical simulations can be performed with any programming language.\n\n- This course focuses on R:\n  - In R, we can use the `deSolve` package to solve the differential equations.\n  - You are welcome to try it in other languages (Tip: Julia is really fast for complex models).\n\n---\n\n### Threshold phenomena\n\n- We can also study the conditions under which an epidemic will grow or die out using the model equations.\n\n- Two key threshold phenomena are often studied:\n  - The basic reproduction number ($R_0$).\n  - The herd immunity threshold.\n\n---\n\n- The [basic reproduction number ($R_0$)]{style=\"color:blue\"}: the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infected individual in a [_completely susceptible_]{style=\"color:tomato;\"} population.\n\n\n- The [herd immunity threshold]{style=\"color:blue\"}: the proportion of the population that needs to be immune (by vaccination or natural infection) to prevent the epidemic from growing. This is often calculated as [$1 - \\dfrac{1}{R_0}$]{style=\"color:red\"}\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=false}\n### Discussion\n\n- How would you interpret the herd immunity required for a disease with $R_0 = 2$?\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Numerical simulations in R\n\n- To solve the model in R, we will always need to define at least three things:\n  - The model equations.\n  - The parameter values.\n  - The initial conditions.\n\n- We will need the `deSolve` package to solve the model.\n\n---\n\n- Let's start by defining the model equations.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Define the SIR model\nsir_model <- function(t, state, parameters) {\n  with(as.list(c(state, parameters)), {\n    dS <- -beta * S * I\n    dI <- beta * S * I - gamma * I\n    dR <- gamma * I\n    return(list(c(dS, dI, dR)))\n  })\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n---\n\nNext, we will define the parameter values and initial conditions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# define parameters we know\nN  <- 1  \nR0 <- 10\ninfectious_period <- 7\n\n# Remember gamma <- 1/ infectious_period as discussed earlier\ngamma <- 1/infectious_period \n\n# We will use R0 = beta N / gamma  instead because it is easier to interpret.\n# beta is not directly interpretable.\n\nparams <- c(beta = R0 * gamma / N, gamma = gamma)\n\n# Initial conditions for S, I, R\n# Why is S = N - 1?\ninits <- c(S = N - 0.001, I = 0.000001, R = 0)\n\n# Time steps to return results\ndt <- 1:70\n```\n:::\n\n\n---\n\nFinally, we will solve the model using the `ode` function from the `deSolve` package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Solve the model\nresults <- deSolve::ode(\n  y = inits,\n  times = dt,\n  func = sir_model,\n  parms = params\n)\n\n# Make it a data.frame\nresults <- as.data.frame(results)\n```\n:::\n\n\n---\n\nNow, let's plot the results.\n\n\n::: {.cell output-location='slide'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the necessary libraries\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n# Create data for ggplot2 by reshaping\nresults_long <- results |> \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(2:4), names_to = \"compartment\", values_to = \"value\")\n  \nplot <- ggplot(data = results_long,\n  aes(x = time, y = value, color = compartment)\n  ) +\ngeom_line(linewidth = 1) +\nlabs(\n  title = \"SIR model\",\n  x = \"Time\",\n  y = \"Number of individuals\"\n) \nprint(plot)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](slides_files/figure-revealjs/plot-sir-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) Model\n\n- Many diseases have an incubation period during which individuals are infected but not yet infectious. Examples include COVID-19 and Ebola.\n- Disease transmission can occur during the incubation period, but the individual is not yet infectious.\n- Capturing this incubation period is essential for understanding the dynamics of the disease and the impact of control measures.\n\n---\n\n![](images/model_diagrams/model_diagrams.002.png){.lightbox}\n\n- The SEIR model extends the SIR model to include an exposed compartment, $E$. The exposed compartment represents individuals who have been infected but are not yet infectious.\n\n---\n\n# Controlling Epidemics\n\n## Modelling Vaccination\n\n- Refer to the slides on vaccination.\n- These work to reduce the number of susceptible individuals, $S$ and infecteds.\n\n## Modelling NPIs\n\n- Refer to the slides on NPIs.\n\n- These work to reduce the transmission rate, $\\beta$.\n\n# Incorporating Host Heterogeneity\n\n- The models we have discussed so far assume that all individuals in the population are identical.\n\n- However, in reality, individuals differ in their susceptibility to infection and their ability to transmit the disease.\n\n- It is essential to capture this heterogeneity in the models in order for the models to be more realistic and useful for decision-making ().\n\n- This can be captured by incorporating heterogeneity into the models.\n\n\n## Incorporating Age Structure\n\n- The models we have discussed so far assume that the population is homogeneous.\n\n- However, in reality, populations are structured by age.\n\n- This can be captured by incorporating age structure into the models.\n\n- Let's extend the SIR model to include age structure.\n\n---\n\n- We will divide the population into $n$ age groups.\n\n- The model will have $3n$ compartments: $S_1, I_1, R_1, S_2, I_2, R_2, ..., S_n, I_n, R_n$.\n\n- The model will have $n^2$ parameters: $\\beta_{ij}$, the transmission rate from age group $i$ to age group $j$.\n\n- The model equations will be:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{dS_i}{dt} &= -\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\beta_{ji} S_i I_j \\\\\n\\dfrac{dI_i}{dt} &= \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\beta_{ji} S_i I_j - \\gamma I_i \\\\\n\\dfrac{dR_i}{dt} &= \\gamma I_i\n\\end{aligned}\n\n- The model can be used to study the impact of age structure on the dynamics of the epidemic.\n\n---\n\n- The model can be used to study the impact of age structure on the dynamics of the epidemic.\n\n- For example, we can study the impact of vaccinating different age groups on the dynamics of the epidemic.\n\n---\n\n- Let's assume that the transmission rate from age group $i$ to age group $j$ is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\beta_{ij} = \\beta_0 \\left(1 + \\alpha \\left(\\dfrac{a_i - a_j}{a_i + a_j}\\right)\\right)\n\\]\n\n- where $\\beta_0$ is the baseline transmission rate, $\\alpha$ is the age-dependent transmission rate, and $a_i$ is the average age of individuals in age group $i$.\n\n---\n\n## Other Heterogeneities\n\n- Other forms of heterogeneity that can be incorporated into the models include:\n\n  - Spatial heterogeneity\n  - Temporal heterogeneity\n  - Contact heterogeneity\n\n# Wrap-Up and Q&A\n\n# What skills are needed to build and use infectious disease models?\n\n## Mathematical and statistical skills\n\n-   Differential equations.\n-   Probability and statistics.\n-   Stochastic processes.\n-   Numerical analysis\n-   Time series analyses\n-   Survival analysis\n\n---\n\n## Programming skills\n\n-   Proficiency in at least one programming language (e.g., R, Python, Julia, C++).\n-   Experience with version control (e.g., Git).\n-   Experience with data manipulation and visualization.\n\n---\n\n## Domain knowledge in infectious diseases\n\n-   Immunology\n-   Epidemiology\n-   Virology\n-   Genomics\n    \n---\n\n## Other subject areas\n\n  - Communication skills:\n    -   Ability to communicate complex ideas to non-experts.\n    -   Ability to write clear and concise reports.\n    -   Ability to present results to a diverse audience.\n  -   Public health.\n  -   Health economics.\n  - Policy analysis.\n\n# List of Resources\n\n## Textbooks\n\n-   [Modeling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals by Matt Keeling and Pejman Rohani](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Modeling-Infectious-Diseases-Humans-Animals/dp/0691116172) -[Epidemics: Models and Data Using R by Ottar N.
