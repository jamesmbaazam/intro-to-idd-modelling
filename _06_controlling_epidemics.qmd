-   Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to control infectious diseases.
-   Conceptually, vaccination works to reduce the number of susceptible individuals, $S$.
:::
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   There are different types of vaccination strategies, including:

    -   [pediatric]{style="color:tomato"} vaccination: vaccinating children to prevent the spread of diseases.
    -   [mass/random]{style="color:tomato"} vaccination: vaccinating a large proportion of the population.
    -   [targeted]{style="color:tomato"} vaccination: vaccinating specific groups of individuals, example, healthcare workers.
    -   [pulse]{style="color:tomato"} vaccination: periodically vaccinating a large number of individuals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Let's consider the case of mass/random vaccination.

-   Compartmental models can be extended to capture this by adding a new compartment, $V$.

-   Let's consider the SEIR model with vaccination.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Vaccinated (SEIRV) Model

-   The SEIRV model is simply the SEIR model with a vaccinated compartment, $V$.
-   The vaccinated compartment represents previously susceptible individuals who have been vaccinated and are immune to the disease.
:::
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   The vaccinated compartment is:

    -   not infectious and does not move to the exposed or infectious compartments.

    -   replenished by the rate of vaccination, $\eta$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The model diagram and equations are as follows:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\frac{dS}{dt} & = -\beta S I - \eta S \\
\frac{dE}{dt} & = \beta S I - \sigma E \\
\frac{dI}{dt} & = \sigma E - \gamma I \\
\frac{dR}{dt} & = \gamma I \\
\frac{dV}{dt} & = \eta S
\end{align}
```

where $\eta$ is the rate of vaccination.

#### Discussion

-   What are some of the assumptions of the SEIRV model?

-   What are the implications of these assumptions for the model's predictions?
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Numerical simulations

#### R Practicals

-   We can use the same approach as the SIR and SEIR models to simulate the SEIRV model.

-   Modify the `seir.Rmd` script to simulate the SEIRV model.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs)

::: {callout-note}
For a background on non-pharmaceutical interventions, refer to @sec-npi.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Conceptually, NPIs usually act to either reduce the transmission rate, $\beta$ or prevent infected individuals from transmitting.

-   NPIs like isolation, social distancing and movement restrictions can reduce the transmission rate, $\beta$, by reducing the contact rate between susceptible and infectious individuals.

-   Hygiene measures reduce the probability of transmission per contact, thereby reducing the transmission rate, $\beta$, since $\beta = c \times p$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Let's consider two scenarios that will extend the SIR model to include NPIs:

    1.  Modifying the transmission rate, $\beta$.
    2.  Preventing infected individuals from transmitting through isolation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Modifying the transmission rate

-   NPIs such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and hand hygiene can reduce the transmission rate, $\beta$.

-   We can model this by making the transmission rate a function of time, $\beta (t)$.

---

The modified SIR model with a reduced transmission rate is as follows:

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} & = -\beta (t) S I \\
\frac{dI}{dt} & = \beta (t) S I - \gamma I \\
\frac{dR}{dt} & = \gamma I
\end{align*}
```

---

-   The simplest form is to reduce $\beta$ by an NPI efficacy, say $\epsilon$.

-   Assuming the NPI is implemented between $t_{\text{npi\_start}}$ and $t_{\text{npi\_end}}$, it means that $\beta$ remains the same before that period and is modified to $(1- \epsilon)\beta$ during the period of the NPI, where $0 \leq \epsilon \leq 1$.

-   With this knowledge, we can define $\beta (t)$ mathematically as:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation*}
\beta(t) = \begin{cases}
\beta & \text{if } t < t_{\text{npi\_start}} \text{ or } t > t_{\text{npi\_end}} \\
(1 - \epsilon) \beta & \text{if } t_{\text{npi\_start}} \le t \le t_{\text{npi\_end}}
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### R Practicals

-   Let's open the script file `sir_npi.R` and follow along.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NPIs as compartments

-   In the previous example, we retained the SIR model structure and modified the transmission rate.

-   We can also model NPIs as compartments in the model. This is useful when we want to treat individuals affected by the NPIs differently.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   For example, isolation is an NPI that prevents infected individuals from transmitting the disease.

-   This means that infected individuals in isolation do not contribute to the transmission of the disease and need to be removed from the infected compartment.

-   Moving isolated individuals to a separate compartment allows us to track them separately in the model and apply relevant parameters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   We can model this by introducing a new compartment, $Q$, for isolating infected individuals.

-   Let's assume, infected individuals move to the isolated compartment at a rate, $\delta$.

-   Infected individuals in the isolated compartment do not transmit the disease.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The modified SIR model with isolated is as follows:

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} & = -\beta S I \\
\frac{dI}{dt} & = \beta S I - \gamma I - \delta I \\
\frac{dR}{dt} & = \gamma I + \tau Q \\
\frac{dQ}{dt} & = \delta I - \tau Q
\end{align*}
```
where $\delta$ is the rate at which infected individuals move to the isolated compartment, and $\tau$ is the rate at which individuals recover from isolation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### R Practicals

-   We can use the same approach as the SIR model to simulate the model with isolation.
-   Modify the SIR model in `sir.Rmd` to incorporate the isolated compartment, $Q$ and the relevant parameters.
